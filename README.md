### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data- Cities included (Newyork,Chicago,Washington)

### Description
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Interesting questions are answered by computing descriptive statistics. 

I learnt about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics.

These statistics are computed:

#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
most common month
most common day of week
most common hour of day
#2 Popular stations and trip

most common start station
most common end station
most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)
#3 Trip duration

total travel time
average travel time
#4 User info

counts of each user type
counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
